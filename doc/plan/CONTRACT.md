### Work Quality 
1. Project standards (What is a realistic level of quality for team presentations, collaborative writing, individual research, preparation of drafts, peer reviews, etc.?):

    - Think about design before functionality
    - Commenting code and making it readable. If it’s not readable then add comments 
    - Git commits often so people can work with your code
    - Individual branches, then functionality branches above, then master above
