- sending the name of the selected profile all the way to ViewGame
- right now it just prints the name but we can find a way to use that to update the profiles stats

- maybe on next sprit figure out how to add a new profile 
- ViewProfile extends OogaProfile and I create a viewprofile from an oogaprofile-- i think there is an easier way to do this
- I don't think viewprofile even needs to extend oogaprofile but i think it may be useful to make new profiles
